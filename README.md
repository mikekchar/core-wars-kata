# Core Wars Kata

Many, many years ago when I was in university, I read
A.K. Dewdney's article on Core Wars and it moved me
to write an implementation for myself.  I spent the whole
weekend writing code and managed to get something that
worked well and even had a graphical representation
of the machine core.

I have often thought, "How long would it take me to
write Core Wars now".  It's been almost 30 years since
I first implemented it and I hope I have improved
a considerable amount.  The old me probably edges the
new me in raw mental horse power, but I should have
a trick or two up my sleeve now.

In this project I will try to implement Core Wars
as well as I can (without the graphics), as quickly
as I can.  For posterity, I will record my progress
using asciinema.  Because I am no longer a student
and don't have the luxury of a whole weekend to
work on things, I will divide my work up into
25 minute pomodoros.  I will make 1 asciinema videa
for each pomodoro.  Apart from the initial setting
up of the project, I will record all the work I
do so that I can see exactly how long it takes me.
It should also be interesting to see what the
recordings look like.
