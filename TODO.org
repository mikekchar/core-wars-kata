* Core Wars Kata
  Finishing on a broken test.  Too bad I didn't write more, but
  we are slowly gathering requirements, so I'm not too sad.
** Burndown
*** Build the memory core
**** TODO Store things in the memory
     I'm not terribly worried about the data size.  We will fix it
     later.
***** TODO Allocate memory
**** TODO Inspect running state of the memory
     I'm going to add an interactive mode.  This will
     allow us to run the program and see that it works.
     There may be some argument that this should have been
     done first.
** Backlog
*** Core options
**** TODO Specify Initial core size
**** TODO Specify Initial instruction to load into the whole core
**** TODO Specify that the core has the same state as last run
     Might have to save the state somehow
**** TODO Specify that the core has a random value
*** TODO Create Core Wars virtual machine
    In this section I will write stories for making the virtual
    machine
*** TODO Load a File into the virtual machine
    Thinking about it, I may need to interleave these stories.

** Done
   I get tired of seeing crap in my TODO list
*** DONE Initial failing test
    CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 13:38]
    I think I already did this.
*** DONE Look at the documentation for Core Wars.
    CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 13:43]
    I added the spec to the doc directory.
    Aaarghh... it's HTML.  Let's open another window.
    Not sure if the documentation explains the virtual machine...
    It must somewhere.  Will need to look more closely.
    But I've seen enough to make a rough plan.
*** General
*** Build the memory core
**** DONE Make a stupid class
     CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 13:53]
**** DONE It needs a size
     CLOSED: [2015-11-13 Fri 10:16]
