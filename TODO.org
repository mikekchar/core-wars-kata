* Core Wars Kata
  Ran out of time.  Need to write test for our command line
  parser.  Next time...
** Burndown
*** Interactive mode
    I'm going to add an interactive mode.  This will
    allow us to run the program and see that it works.
    There may be some argument that this should have been
    done first.
**** TODO Add command switch to enter interactive mode
     No idea how to test drive this.  Let's not.
     WRITE TESTS!!!
**** TODO Add interactive exit command
     Implement input with Readline library
*** Inspect running state of the memory
    Since this is a "retro" project, I thought it would be fun
    to implement the command set from the old Apple II
    machine language monitor
**** TODO {addr}
     Inspect one memory location
**** TODO {addr1}.{addr2}
      Inspect memory from addr1 to addr2
**** TODO [RETURN]
      Display up to 8 locations following the last opened location.
** Backlog
*** Core options
**** TODO Specify Initial core size
**** TODO Specify Initial instruction to load into the whole core
**** TODO Specify that the core has the same state as last run
     Might have to save the state somehow
**** TODO Specify that the core has a random value
*** TODO Create Core Wars virtual machine
    In this section I will write stories for making the virtual
    machine
*** TODO Load a File into the virtual machine
    Thinking about it, I may need to interleave these stories.

** Done
*** Setup
**** DONE Initial failing test

     I think I already did this.
**** DONE Look at the documentation for Core Wars.
     CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 13:43]
     I added the spec to the doc directory.
     Aaarghh... it's HTML.  Let's open another window.
     Not sure if the documentation explains the virtual machine...
     It must somewhere.  Will need to look more closely.
     But I've seen enough to make a rough plan.
*** Interactive mode
**** DONE Add an executable
     CLOSED: [2015-11-16 Mon 12:58]
*** Build the memory core
**** DONE Make a stupid class
     CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 13:53]
**** DONE It needs a size
     CLOSED: [2015-11-13 Fri 10:16]
**** DONE Store things in the memory
     CLOSED: [2015-11-16 Mon 09:42]
     I'm not terribly worried about the data size.  We will fix it
     later.
***** DONE Allocate memory
      CLOSED: [2015-11-16 Mon 09:31]
***** DONE Determine if we should wrap on setting addresses
      CLOSED: [2015-11-16 Mon 09:42]
      i.e. should store(size+1) set the zeroth value?
      There appears to be a concept of "folding" that does this.
      I don't quite understand, but I will defer this until
      we implement addressing modes.
