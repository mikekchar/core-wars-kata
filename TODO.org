* Core Wars Kata
  Making a lot of mistakes on ruby syntax.  Hopefully
  I will start remembering the language again soon!
** Burndown
*** Interactive mode
    I'm going to add an interactive mode.  This will
    allow us to run the program and see that it works.
    There may be some argument that this should have been
    done first.
**** TODO Add interactive exit command
     I suppose ctl-D can also exit since it already does that
*** Inspect running state of the memory
    Since this is a "retro" project, I thought it would be fun
    to implement the command set from the old Apple II
    machine language monitor
**** TODO {addr}
     Inspect one memory location
**** TODO {addr1}.{addr2}
      Inspect memory from addr1 to addr2
**** TODO [RETURN]
      Display up to 8 locations following the last opened location.
** Backlog
*** Core options
**** TODO Specify Initial core size
**** TODO Specify Initial instruction to load into the whole core
**** TODO Specify that the core has the same state as last run
     Might have to save the state somehow
**** TODO Specify that the core has a random value
*** TODO Create Core Wars virtual machine
    In this section I will write stories for making the virtual
    machine
*** TODO Load a File into the virtual machine
    Thinking about it, I may need to interleave these stories.

** Done
*** Setup
**** DONE Initial failing test

     I think I already did this.
**** DONE Look at the documentation for Core Wars.

     I added the spec to the doc directory.
     Aaarghh... it's HTML.  Let's open another window.
     Not sure if the documentation explains the virtual machine...
     It must somewhere.  Will need to look more closely.
     But I've seen enough to make a rough plan.
*** Interactive mode
**** DONE Add an executable

*** Build the memory core
**** DONE Make a stupid class
     CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 13:53]
**** DONE It needs a size
     CLOSED: [2015-11-13 Fri 10:16]
**** DONE Store things in the memory
     CLOSED: [2015-11-16 Mon 09:42]
     I'm not terribly worried about the data size.  We will fix it
     later.
***** DONE Allocate memory
      CLOSED: [2015-11-16 Mon 09:31]
***** DONE Determine if we should wrap on setting addresses
      CLOSED: [2015-11-16 Mon 09:42]
      i.e. should store(size+1) set the zeroth value?
      There appears to be a concept of "folding" that does this.
      I don't quite understand, but I will defer this until
      we implement addressing modes.
*** Interactive mode
**** DONE Add command switch to enter interactive mode
     CLOSED: [2015-11-17 Tue 14:49]
     No idea how to test drive this.  Let's not.
     WRITE TESTS!!!
     Good enough for now.
**** DONE Add a monitor that can take input
