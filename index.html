    <h1>One Pomodoro A Day - A Core Wars Kata</h1>
    <h2>What is One Pomodoro A Day?</h2>
    <p>
    On this page you can watch as I attempt to do a very long kata --
    one pomodoro a day.  If you are not familiar with the concept of
    a kata, it is a term taken from Japanese martial arts and refers
    to a form that one executes in order to practice.  The term was
    coined by Dave Thomas <a href="http://codekata.com">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the downsides of doing a kata as practice is that it is
    necessarily limited.  Usually it is a task that last 30 minutes
    or so.  Trying to explore larger problems of requirements gathering
    and program design is much more difficult because ordinarily
    people don't have time to devote themselves to a large project
    for an extended period of time.  Enter the pomodoro technique.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">
      The pomodoro technique
    </a> is a time management method for splitting up your task into
    small chunks of time (usually 25 minutes), separated by short
    breaks.  The chunks of time are called <em>pomodoros</em>.  My
    approach in this experiment is to try to do a very long kata
    (approximately 30-40 hours), doing an average of one pomodoro
    a day.  Below you can follow my progress by watching the
    <a href="https:asciinema.org">Asciinema</a> animations of each
    pomodoro session.

    <h2>What is Core Wars?</h2>
    <p>
    Core Wars is a game devised by computer scientist A. K. Dewdney
    in 1984.  It was first described in an article in Scientific
    American and became relatively popular in the late 1980s and
    early 1990s with computer programmers.  From the original article:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Two computer programs in their native habitat -- the memory
      chips of a digital computer -- stalk each other from address to
      address.  Sometimes they go scouting for the enemy; sometimes
      they lay down a barrage of numeric bombs; sometimes they copy
      themselves out of danger or stop to repair damage.  This is the
      game I call Core War.  It is unlike almost all other computer
      games in that people do not play at all!  The contending programs
      are written by people, of course, but once a battle is under
      way the creator of a program can do nothing but watch helplessly
      as the product of hours spent in design and implementation either
      lives or dies on the screen.  The outcome depends entirely on
      which program is hit first in a vulnerable area.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Core Wars is quite nostalgic for me as, after reading the original
    article, I rushed to write my own implementation of the game.
    I remember starting on a Friday evening and working every waking
    hour so that I could have it functional by Sunday night.  It was
    a crude implementation with numerous bugs, but it was very fun
    to play.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have often thought, "How long would it take me to
    write Core Wars now".  It's been almost 30 years since
    I first implemented it and I hope I have improved
    a considerable amount.  The old me probably edges the
    new me in raw mental horse power, but I should have
    a trick or two up my sleeve now.
